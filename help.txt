usage: ./calculator

    key:
        [] denotes a default value.
        <> denotes an optional command.

    general usage syntax:
        The calculation functionality is constantly running. When prompted
        with "$ ", the calculator is accepting general input. Input that is
        not a command should be in the form of standard mathematical notation.

        general syntactic rules:
            Trig functions and log() are followed by an open and close parenthesis.
            (eg. log(x), sin(x^2), cos(sin(x)), etc...)

            The general order of operations applies, so properly parenthesized expressions
            are necessary to achieve accurate outputs.

    commands during runtime:
        /help                           displays this message.
        /base <expression>              changes the current log base. [10]
        /fadd <expression>              adds a function to the first open slot in the function table.
        /fremove <index>                removes the function at the given index from the function table.
        /xval <expression>              changes the current value of x for general calculations. [0]
        /ftable                         outputs the current function table (functions stored in the function table are used
                                for graphing purposes.) [x^2, (empty), (empty), ...]
        /fclear                         clears the current function table.
        /window                         displays the window bounds for the graph display and prompts changes.
        /graph <expression>             draws ascii display with every equation in the function table graphed.
        /integrate <expression>         prompts selection of a function from the function table, integrates under that
                                function between prompted lower and upper bounds, and outputs the definite integral as well
                                as the ascii display with the area shaded.
        /graphdx <expression>           draws ascii display with every equation in the function table's derivative graphed.
        /quit                           saves the current states of the function table and window bounds, exits the program.
